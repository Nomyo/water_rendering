# Real-time water rendering

This project is written in C++ using OpenGL API. The rendering bellow shows the result of projections mapping with reflection, refraction, DuDv map for distorsion and finally normal mapping. You can also see the Fresnel effect in the gif :).

A lot of improvements can be done on the project but here, I just aimed to work more with OpenGL and graphics technique. Soft-edges can be added, some movement depending on the time to form real waves, etc.
