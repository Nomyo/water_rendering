# Real-time water rendering

This project is written in C++ using OpenGL API. The rendering bellow shows the result of projections mapping with reflection, refraction, DuDv map for distorsion and finally normal mapping.

A lot of improvements can be done on the project but here, I just aimed to work more with OpenGL and graphics technique. Soft-edges can be added, some movement depending on the time to form real waves, etc.
